## Analysis
Analysis was done on SQL. Click [here]() to see the complete SQL analysis.

### Steps

1. Data Import: The raw data  was imported into the SQL database. This was done using the SQL Server Import and Export Wizard tool.

2. Data Exploration: I explored the data to understand its structure, contents, and potential issues. Using SQL queries to examine the tables, columns, and sample records.

3. Data Cleaning: Cleanse the data to ensure accuracy and consistency. Perform tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, standardizing formats, and correcting errors using SQL statements like UPDATE, DELETE, and INSERT.

4. Data Transformation: Transform the data to make it suitable for analysis. Use SQL functions and operators to perform calculations, aggregations, joins, and filtering operations. Create new derived columns or tables as needed.

5. Data Analysis: Apply SQL queries and functions to extract insights from the data. Use SELECT statements with appropriate conditions, aggregations, and groupings to analyze trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

6. Data Visualization: Visualize the analyzed data using SQL-based reporting tools or by exporting the results to other visualization tools. Use SQL queries to retrieve the required data and present it in charts, graphs, or tables.

7. Data Validation: Validate the results of your analysis to ensure accuracy. Cross-check the findings with known benchmarks or use statistical techniques to validate the outcomes.

8. Documentation: Document the entire data analysis process, including the SQL queries used, assumptions made, and any limitations or caveats. This documentation will help in replicating the analysis and communicating the results to stakeholders.

9. Optimization: Optimize the SQL queries for performance if needed. Use techniques like indexing, query optimization, and data partitioning to improve the speed and efficiency of your analysis.

10. Iterative Process: Data analysis is often an iterative process. Refine your SQL queries, explore additional variables, or conduct further analysis based on the initial results. Continuously iterate and improve your analysis as you gain more insights.
