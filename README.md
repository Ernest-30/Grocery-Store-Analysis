## Overview
This data analysis project focuses on analyzing sales performance using SQL Server and visualizing the insights using Power BI. The project aims to provide valuable insights into sales trends, performance metrics, key factors impacting revenue generation and answer Business Questions.

## Analysis

Please refer to the attached SQL Server [Code](https://github.com/Ernest-30/Sunnyside-Store-Sales-Analysis/blob/main/Sunnyside%20Store%20Analysis.sql) for the detailed analysis.

### Steps

2. Data Cleaning: I cleansed the data to ensure accuracy and consistency this included standardizing the formats, and correcting errors.

3.  Data Transformation: I transformed the data to make it suitable for analysis. This transformation includes calculations, aggregations, and filtering operations. I also created new columns required for the analysis.

4.  Data Analysis: I applied SQL queries and functions to extract insights from the data. Using the SELECT statements with appropriate conditions, aggregations, and groupings to analyze trends, patterns, and relationships in the data.

5.  Data Visualization: I visualized the analyzed data by exporting the results to Microsoft Power BI where I presented it in charts and graphs and created a dashboard.

The analysis covers various aspects of the sales data to gain meaningful insights and answer the following business questions:

Approximately 11% of the total orders received experienced delayed shipping, indicating a need for improved logistics and fulfillment processes to ensure timely delivery. 
Efforts should be made to minimize such delays and enhance the overall customer experience by focusing on efficient shipping practices.
 
### 8. Which Countries are the top 10 performers in terms of revenue?

The chart above shows the top 10 performing Countries by revenue with China emerging as the Country with the highest revenue contribution.

### 9. What is the Top performing Item Type by Revenue?

Household items have emerged as the top-performing category in terms of revenue, showcasing their strong demand and profitability. On the other hand, fruits items have shown comparatively lower performance in terms of revenue, suggesting potential areas for improvement or adjustments in pricing, marketing, or product offerings within this category.

### 10. What is the Order Contribution by Sales Channel for the Top Performing Item by Revenue?

The offline channel has slightly contributed more than the online channel in terms of the number of orders received for the top-performing item (household) in terms of revenue. This indicates that customers are still inclined towards traditional brick-and-mortar stores when purchasing household items, despite the growing popularity of online shopping.

## Sales Dashboard

The project includes the development of a comprehensive sales dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard presents key metrics and visualizations to provide a clear overview of the sales performance and trends. The dashboard includes interactive charts, graphs, and filters to facilitate data exploration and analysis.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

### Conclusion:
The analysis of the Sunnyside Stores dataset provides valuable insights into the sales performance, revenue trends, and customer behavior. Several key findings emerged from the analysis, including the highest sales performance in 2011 and the lowest in 2017. May stood out as the month with the highest revenue, while Fridays recorded the highest revenue contribution among the days of the week. Q1 of 2015 demonstrated the highest revenue, with January and Fridays leading in revenue generation.

The analysis also revealed that weekends accounted for a relatively small percentage of total orders, indicating potential opportunities to target and attract more customers during weekends. The Sub-Saharan Africa region emerged as the most profitable region, while approximately 11% of orders experienced late deliveries, suggesting a need for improved logistics and fulfillment processes.

### Recommendations:
1. Focus on leveraging the success of high-performing years, such as 2011, to identify and replicate strategies that drove exceptional sales growth.

2. Develop targeted marketing campaigns and promotions to capitalize on the high revenue months, particularly May, and devise strategies to drive sales during lower-performing months like February.

3. Implement strategies to optimize operations on Fridays, considering their significance in revenue generation. This may include increased staffing, special promotions, or tailored product offerings.

4. Explore ways to increase customer engagement and attract more orders during weekends, such as offering exclusive weekend deals or enhancing the online shopping experience.

5. Continuously monitor and improve the logistics and fulfillment processes to minimize late deliveries and ensure timely order fulfillment.

6. Further explore the potential of the Sub-Saharan Africa region by expanding marketing efforts, increasing product availability, and understanding local customer preferences and behaviors.

7. Evaluate and refine the product offerings and marketing strategies for the fruits category to improve its revenue performance.

8. Consider the preferences and behaviors of customers in different sales channels, both online and offline, to optimize marketing efforts and enhance customer experience.

By implementing these recommendations, Urban Essential Stores can further improve their sales performance, customer satisfaction, and overall business success.
